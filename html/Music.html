                        Yeah I can see you in the shade.
                        I can see you in them shades.
                        Yeah I can see you in the shade.
                        Whatever gets you away.
                        Whatever gets you away. I could see you in the -

                        It still takes some time to cover up your lies.
                        Your shades so dark it even covers up your eyes.
                        Yeah I've seen you in your shady shady moments, but it's not you and will you let it define?

                        Cuz I don't really wanna be seen in the night time
                        When you keep on telling me that this is not the right time.
                        Where will you be seein the light on your timeline and
                        how could I feel so happy next to you while you're so sad?
                        Said why you so -
                        Said why you so sad?
                        Said why you so – sad?

                        It still takes you time to cover up your lies.
                        Just come out of the darkness; what do you gotta hide?
                        Cuz shade's takin over. And the damn shade's takin all of your time.

                        I could see you in the shade.
                        I could see you in the shade.

                        Well, I don't really wanna be seen in the night time.
                        Stop tellin me that this is not the right time.
                        Why do I feel like you've fallen to the dark side.
                        How could I be so happy next to you and why you so sad?
                        And why you so sad?
                        And why you so – sad?

                        I could see you in the shade.

                        Just come out of the shade.

                    Scene
                    Just. Chick-a-yeah.
                    Just get off your phones.
                    Just get off your phones.
                    Just get off your -
                    Just get off your phones.
                    Let's get off our phones.
                    Let's get off our phones.
                    Let's get off your – phones.
                    Just get off your phones.

                    Said if you wanna make a scene, ask us to just turn it up a little bit louder.
                    And if you wanna see how we move, well, just move it a little bit faster.
                    I said, I don't know your name but I'm gonna know it by the end of the night.
                    And you're probably just the same but there was something bout them look in your eyes.
                    Said if you wanna make a scene, up to you to turn it up a little bit louder.
                    And if you're askin me how we move, we're moving like a natural disaster.

                    I still don't know your name but I can see you in the dark of the night.
                    And I hope you won't complain when I see right through your luminous plight.
                    Said raise some questions! If you thought it before, let your thoughts be resurrected.
                    You keep on checkin; well somethin's not right with your thoughts bein directed.
                    Let's raise some questions. If you're ready to move, let's reveal our connection.
                    Don't call into question – it's the time of the night for good fun and suggestions.
                    Ooh.

                    Said if
                    you wanna make a scene, then do.


                    Just Say No
                    I said sometimes when I close my eyes I think I'm you instead.
                    So please don't compromise these thoughts as they cross right through your head.
                    You see times I would think; I would question everything.
                    But this time, I'm really done thinking; I'm really done questioning. Done Questioning.

                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.

                    It's easier said than done but what's already been said is already gone.
                    My words will make you think faster than your thoughts can comprehend.
                    So we said how could we let this one pass?
                    Did I really let it go, let her go?
                    Cuz most times I say yeah but this time I just said no.
                    I just gotta know one thing – stop! What you doin?
                    I know this shit don't mean a thing
                    but trust me when I say I'm done choosing and I'm done questioning (done).

                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.

                    Say when the lights dim down can we take this back to my place?
                    Do you remember those times when I didn't even know your name?
                    Said we would sit across the room; I would think of something funny to say to you.
                    But when the lights dim down, I just want to see your face.
                    And when the lights turn on, I've never really seen your face.

                    Cuz most times I just say, let it go; let her go.
                    But this time I try to say yeah but I really said no. Just say no.

                    Just say – Just say – Just say no. Just say no.


                    Look Me In The Eyes
                    Said is it possible to feel with just your eyes?
                    Cuz there's an obstacle inbetween you and I.
                    Is there anything on your mind that makes you look away?
                    And is there anything I can do to make a change?

                    Why don't you just look me in the eyes?
                    So, why don't you just look me in the eyes?

                    Uh – come on!
                    I'm feelin somethin in the way that you're movin; it's not right. Oh why?
                    You give me reasons but all I'm really hearin is your lies. Oh why?
                    When the world got bright, but you didn't see it.
                    Such an illuminating sight, but you don't wanna hear it.

                    So why don't you just look me in the eyes?
                    Why don't you just look me in the eyes?

                    Ooh. Yeah. Whoaa. Yeah.
                    Still somethin, little somethin in the air that really don't feel right.
                    I see your eyes; they're botherin botherin my light.
                    Just look me in the eyes, yeah.
                    Eh. Ooh. Eh. Yeah.
                    Just look me in the eyes.

                    But still somethin in the way you're moving really don't shiftin feel right.
                    Still the way you're moving - it really don't sit right.
                    Can't even take plans; just look me in the-
                    Can't even take a chance; just look me in the-
                    Woo. Ohh.


                    Chosen
                    Lazy people, get up; let's go out for one night.
                    You're always waiting for that look in my eyes
                    But even with one glance, I could make you go blind.
                    And as the sun comes down, I'll still show you the light. Whoaa.

                    Know that I am certain that I am the chosen one tonight.
                    Baby, are you certain that I could be chosen tonight?

                    Don't worry about your friends; they'll still be there in the end.
                    Don't worry about your friends; they'll still be there in the end.

                    Come on! Buckle up; it's gonna be a bumpy ride.
                    When I didn't say the rules, I thought they were implied.
                    Just spend one night with me; you'll be gone for life.
                    But when I'm done with you, you'll probably lose your mind.

                    Know that I am certain that I am the chosen one tonight.
                    Baby, are you certain that I could be chosen tonight?

                    Yeah. Don't worry about a thing; I know we're chosen in the end.
                    Don't worry about your friends; I know they'll be there in the end.
                    Just know that I'm certain that I could be chosen tonight.
                    Baby, are you certain that I am the chosen one tonight?

                    Certain. Baby, are you certain?
                    Baby, are you certain that I am the chosen one tonight?
                    Know that I'm certain that I could be the chosen one tonight.


                    Not Talkin
                    Please, think of something to say.
                    I would pay to have this conversation reimagined with words and not pain.
                    See I can't really think of anyhting running through thi sbrain.
                    So just pick another subject and, well, I'll try to do the same
                    Cuz we're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same ways.

                    Yeah. This time I can't think of things running through my mind.
                    So just pick a fuckin subject and, well, I think we'll be alright.
                    I said pick somethin. Say something; aren't we out of words?
                    I would write you a song but let's just start with this verse like
                    we're just not talkin the same. We're just not talkin.
                    We're just not talkin the same. We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    Just not talkin the same ways. We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same – we're just not.
                    Got to getcha!

                    Ooh. Ooh. Sing ohh ooh.

                    We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    We're just not talkin the same ways.
                    Mmmmmm yeah.
